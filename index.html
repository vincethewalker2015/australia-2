           We had an early start after a quick breakfast and got away at 6:20 am. Encountered our first setback when we discovered city link was closed and so had to go over the Westgate bridge to get on the ring road. Had a quick coffee stop in Shepparton which turned out to be a second breakfast stop for some. Then we drove through Dairy farming country, and Kenneth gave us a brief three hour summary of the industry from his insider perspective. He worked for Murray Goulbourn for several years so knew about all about cheese processing. It was very thorough and started of with the historic origins in 1860 when farmer Pat Maloney discovered his 2 cows were getting quite fat and producing lots of milk. I missed most of it as I had a 2 hour nap, but woke up just in time to hear the final corporate shenanigans of Kraft buying out the cheesy whizz sticks brand. No dull moments on this trip so far!. Seeing a lot of big trucks going the other way, taking sheep on day trip excursions.
            One problem solved today by Ken was the intermittent charging problem with my phone. Who would have believed that phone charger slots are like navels and they collect lint. Kenneth deftly removed a few balls of blue lint from by phone's navel with a pin and it now charges perfectly.

            The excitement was really building today as we were off to see the "DISH'.
            It did not disappoint as while we were there they had it moving to a new position. 
            The dish is booked out years in advance by research scientists and at the time was being used 
            by the SUPERBx program. If you don't already know, this stands for the SUrvey for Pulsars & 
            Extragalactic Radio Bursts Extension. I could explain what this means but it would take too long. 
            Needless to say when I asked if we could use it that arvo for some cricket practise, 
            I got a pained look. Vince and I bought dish pin hats which we will treasure for the rest of our l
            ives, although I seem to have lost mine already. As we left the dish, there was an exhibit of two 
            small (2 metre high) concave dishes about 70 metres apart. The instructions were for a person to 
            stand in front of each dish and whisper to the other person. Ken and I did this and it was amazing 
            how the whisper was focussed by the dish and sent 70m away. It really demonstrated how the dish's 
            concave shape worked.

              Dubbo is the noisiest place I have tried to sleep at for a long time. I reckon a homeless person 
              at Flinders street station would have a quieter night. I think it is the intersection of many truck 
              routes and the trucks constantly slow down as they enter town applying their air brakes.
              Went to the Open plains zoo at Dubbo today. It was very well presented and well worth it. 
              The enclosures were quite large so the animals seem to have lots of room. We even saw a rhino 
              running, something not seen every day.
              Back on the road and we have adopted the roles that Nic discovered on a previous trip to end 
              arguments. These are:
              <strong>The Driver:</strong> Drive, Focus on road, Don't kill us
              <strong>Shotgun:</strong> Stay awake, Mad DJ skills, Navigate so hard
              <strong>Back seat:</strong> Snack distributor in chief, Remind front seat people that's bathrooms exist, Nap like a boss.
              So far it seems to be working. Ignore that last comment. Shotgun managed to miss the turnoff for the Castelereagh highway at Gilgandra, despite the GPS telling him and the driver to do so. They then blindly followed the GPS, to recover which took us on a 20k detour on dirt roads until the back seat intervened. We were travelling on a parallel dirt road to the highway, which only seemed to join up 50ks up the road. After 2 u turns we reconnected to the right road. Sometimes it isn’t advisable to "nap like a boss"!.
              We did finally make it to Lightning Ridge in time for happy hour in the beer garden. Lightning Ridge is an opal mining town, much like Coober Pedy. It is very dry and there is not much vegetation. The caravan park was just a dirt patch with no grass, but they had a central camp kitchen and beer garden and there were about 30 grey nomads sitting around enjoying the free pizza. As soon as the free pizza ended, the grey nomads retreated into their vans and we had the camp kitchen to ourselves. It was very pleasant sitting around the fire pit with a red wine watching the full moon rising - Awoooooooooo!

              Next day - whatever it is. <br />
              (Jockey wheel episode 1)<br />
              Packed up and set off to see "Chambers of the black hand" unfortunately we needed to go down 
              some suspect dirt roads with the camper, so decided against it. Just then, my phone rang and it 
              was the Lightning Ridge caravan park owner to inform us that we had forgotten Kenneth. 
              Only kidding, they said we had driven off and left behind the jockey wheel of the caravan. 
              Vince and I immediately glared at "he who cannot be named" who had taken it off. Put it aside 
              and forgotten to put it in the car. He was publicly shamed when we drove up to the office to 
              retrieve it and we made him get out and fetch it. <br /><br />          
              Drove to Hebel and stopped at the only store in "town" for a coffee. Coffee was fine but the store 
              was up for sale and would close in a few months if no buyer was found. It would be a tragedy if Hebel 
              had no good coffee shop.<br /><br />
              Stopped for lunch at St George, which claims to to be the fresh water fishing capital of Queensland. 
              It is a very picturesque town along the banks of the Balonne river. We had lunch sitting on the grassy 
              banks and I read a sign that said the predominant fish in the river were biting bream that fed on algae and 
              other vegetation. Made me wonder how you catch a vegetarian fish? Do you use tofu for bait? Perhaps my fishing 
              coach has an answer.<br /><br />
              Stopped at Roma for the night at a caravan park next to the Big Rig, a tourist attraction based on the towns 
              origins as the cradle of the Australian oil and gas industry. We booked in for the night time extravaganza 
              show at the Big Rig at 7pm. When we arrived, a young lady took our cash along with about 20 others. We were 
              seated in a small open air theatre with a big screen at one end and what looked like a diorama of tents in 
              the foreground around some diggings. The young lady started a 30 minute movie, then left the theatre, got in 
              car and drove off. We were treated to historical documentary on the oil exploration around Roma beginning 
              in 1854. Special effects, in the form of lights going on and off in the tents and within the campfire 
              together with some smoke at critical times enhanced the experience. Riveting stuff, at one stage Kenneth 
              produced a packet of marshmallows and begun toasting them on the electric bar heaters they had supplied to 
              keep the patrons warm. A few minutes before the end of the show, the young lady returned, this time carrying 
              a sleepy toddler in her arms. After the show, after the rapturous applause and a standing ovation, she 
              showed us out.

        I know the day because visits to the famous cattle yards were conducted only on Tuesday's and Thursday's, 
        we timed it perfectly, or so we thought.
        We arrived at the cattle yards at 8:20 am to discover that this week the Thursday cattle sale had been 
        cancelled due to a cattleman convention in Brisbane. Disappointing to say the least, but at least the 
        free tour was still on. So we were treated to a tour of the cattle yards, sans cattle. The highlight was 
        when they brought in an auctioneer to give us a live demonstration of an actual auction. They asked if 
        anyone would volunteer their partner to be auctioned off. Not a very politically correct request, so was no 
        surprise that no one took up the offer. After first making it perfectly clear that Vince was not my partner, 
        I offered up one Pommy Tourist for the auction demonstration. The auctioneer went through a flurry of 
        indecipherable ravings, pretending to get bids from the audience and settled on a sale price of $1.32/kg live 
        weight. This equates to Vince being worth about $134, I think a top price for him knowing what he has been 
        fed recently. <br /><br />
        We then set off for Emerald, but discovered that we would be passing by Carnarvon Gorge. We hastily all 
        agreed to change plans and stay overnight at the Gorge. What a wise decision that turned out to be.
        Carnarvon Gorge is an idyllic National park on a par with Wilpena pound. The Takarakka Bush Resort where we stayed is a fantastic oasis in the middle of the outback. Nestled at the mouth of the gorge, surrounded by a stream and plenty of shady trees. We got an unpowered site in an area all of our own with a great fire pit. Went for a short walk on the first day to the rock pools and saw echidna and Roos in abundance. Platypus are often around but we saw none. We immediately decided to stay another night so we could do a bigger walk the next day. We spent the night sitting around a large campfire, under the clear night sky admiring the stars.
        There is no phone coverage and no wifi, so we are off the grid, including the electricity grid - what a shame!

        Friday I think.. <br />
        Woken early by a Cookaburra calling out and set about our big walk. The plan was to do a 14 km hike 
        and see 4 attractions; the Moss garden , Ampitheatre, Ward's canyon and Art gallery. All did not 
        disappoint, but the Ampitheatre was the most spectacular. It was a cavern entered through a narrow crack 
        in the 100 metre high cliff face. Once inside it opened out into a 50m x20m cavity with 100m high sandstone 
        walls opening out to the sky above - absolutely amazing. After the 14km walk we were a bit weary and had a 
        beer for lunch.
        Tomorrow we have to make up lost time for the 2 day detour, but we all agreed it was the best place we 
        have been to so far. Definitely on my recommended list and visit again list. The walks are really well 
        maintained and easy to follow and the campsite is a pleasure with many added extra's. Tonight they are 
        showing the movie "Lion" on an outdoor screen. <br />
        Bugger, I can't put my footy tips in !!!

        We decided on an early start and to get up when we heard the first kookaburra call. This happened just 
        after 6 am and we all snoozed on until the second Kookaburra call. It was as if we had hit the snooze 
        button on nature. We were on the road just after 7 as we had some miles to catch up.
        We are blessed with 2 Gps systems on this trip. An inferior one that we have been using in this car for 
        a while and Kenneth's vastly superior one. It can calculate 6 different routes and gives us the best 
        option after 10 different preference settings. It has 3 different trip settings you can use to monitor 
        each leg of your journey. It can monitor the drivers fluid indicate and tell him when he needs to take a piss. 
        There is nothing really it can't do, so it is a surprise that we have already got lost once. 
        The existing Gps is suffering from an inferiority complex and deliberately giving us wrong directions.<br /><br />
        (Jockey wheel episode 2.)<br />
        We stopped off at Charters Towers after a long days driving. We managed to get the second last powered 
        site which was on a gentle grassy slope. As there was not much clearance, the Jockey wheel was put in 
        with all the gripping rings above the clamp. We detached the car but could not wind up the van as it just 
        slipped down the jockey wheel shaft. After much discussion and proposals we decided to re attach it to the 
        car, move it down the slope a bit till we had more clearance and then try put the jockey wheel back on. 
        After the move, we attempted to reattach the jockey wheel, in doing so we noticed it still needed more 
        clearance and had to be wound down lower. At this stage we discovered it had not been lowered in the first 
        place, and if it had been, we would not have needed to move the van again. All this was done under the 
        watchful eyes of the grey nomads already "chardonnaying" on their camp chairs, providing them some mirthful 
        entertainment. Two strikes on the jockey wheel for one of us, one more and they are out.

        (Coffee pot episode 1) <br />
        We have been on the road for a week now, so we have got in to a pretty good routine in the mornings. 
        First one up puts the coffee percolator on and when it has bubbled through, 2 of us can have a coffee. 
        We then put a half full pot on for the 3rd person. This morning after Vince and I had the first 2 cups, 
        I put the pot on for Kenneth (who was having a shower) and told Vince to keep an eye on it while I too 
        went for a shower. When I returned into the van, I noticed the coffee pot was still on. I checked it and 
        coffee was boiling away in the top of the pot and the water container had long since run dry. I whisked the 
        percolator off the stove and placed it in the steel sink where it sizzled like mad when contacting the water 
        he sink. The top of the stove was all silver where the coffee pot had started melting. Vince said he had not 
        heard the noise of the coffee percolating and Kenneth said he checked the coffee in the top part of the 
        percolator but it was too dark, so he opened the curtains to let in more light and left it. Once it had 
        cooled down we removed it from the sink and noticed the underside of the sink had a plastic mat which had 
        melted and dripped hot plastic into the dishes below. It must have been pretty hot to melt the coffee pot and 
        the underside of the sink. Who knows what would have happened if I had taken another 10 minutes in the shower. 
        We will have to see if the coffee pot is able to continue on the trip tomorrow, otherwise a roadside burial ceremony 
        will be held for its death whilst on duty.

        (Gone fishing)<br />
        The coffee pot survived - Hooray.<br />
        Went on a 6 hour fishing trip with Boland-San on the Daintree river. An early start as we were picked up 
        at 6:45 am. There were only 3 on the boat, the guide, Paul and I. After launching we went down to the mouth 
        of the river and fished with lures, casting as close as possible to the mangroves at the edge of the river. 
        Before long I caught our first fish, a Mangrove jack and at 40cm, a keeper. Paul then caught 3 in a row, a 
        Fingermark, a trevally and a Groper, 4 fish in the first 90 minutes! Things slowed down after that and we 
        then made our way up river and changed lures to try for Barra. Paul caught the first Barra, after a short 
        fight it was landed and came in at 56cm, too short to be a keeper though. However the guide seemed overly 
        protective of the Barra and wanted us to throw it back, which we did. I think in his view, the legal size is 
        2cm more than whatever fish you catch. I can understand his viewpoint as it is after all, his livelihood to 
        ensure there are lots of Barra to catch. I too hooked a Barra, but it got off, so none for me. The guide was 
        an expert lure fisherman and could throw his lure to within a foot of where he wanted to land it. He caught 2 
        Barra quite easily but let them go. I ended up casting into he trees a number of times and getting snagged, 
        but we always managed to go back and retrieve the lures. In the end, the tally was; Paul 6, me 3. We kept 3 
        fish for dinner that night. On the river we saw 4 crocks, including one that was about 3.5 metres, sunning itself 
        on the bank, a reminder not to swim in the river or wash your hands over the side of the boat for too long. 
        Along the riverbank it is mostly mangroves, but there were small sections of open pastures and on one of 
        them there were fisherman. Crazy as it sounds they were only about 700 meters from where we saw the large croc. 
        What do you call someone fishing from the banks on the Daintree? - Croc food.
        Paul and Karen cooked up a wonderful meal for us with the fish in their penthouse apartment above Port Douglas. 
        It was the first time we had had a 3 course meal in 8 days that didn't have two of the courses being chips and 
        a snickers bar.

        (Jockey wheel episode 3)<br />
        Shortly after getting up, Kenneth complained that it felt he was walking downhill to the door of the 
        caravan. He seemed to be overly focussed on the level of the van on this trip so far, so I ignored him. 
        He got the spirit level out and showed me that the bubble was off the chart, the van was indeed at a steep 
        angle pointing down. We went to have a look at the front to see what had happened and discovered our jockey 
        wheel had been stolen!!!!. You have to be scum of the earth to steal a caravanner’s jockey wheel. We called 
        Vince over and he had a look. Vince then confessed to being super efficient and once setting up the caravan 
        when we arrived, he used his initiative and took the jockey wheel off and stowed it away. So it was an inside 
        job. We had to get the car jack out and lift the van up, to get the jockey wheel back on. Vince has been banned 
        from using his initiative from now on and we have instituted South African labour rules for him from now on. 
        He has to check with the Baas (me) before he does anything.

        Nothing very exciting happened today. Vince and I had a long walk to the end of 4 mile beach in the morning, 
        together with dozens of other grey nomads and the occasional jogger with tight b...., I mean shorts. 
        We then drove to Kuranda, a mountaintop oasis in the Atherton Tablelands on the Barron river. The river 
        cascades over the Barron falls which are over 100 metres high. As it is very dry at the moment, there is only 
        a small stream of water, but nonetheless still a spectacular sight. The shops have deteriorated since I was 
        here 10 years ago and seem mostly to sell tacky souvenirs. The good art galleries I remembered, and purchased 
        prints from, have been mostly replaced by cheap aboriginal art works and photo prints.

        Early start this morning as we were going fishing. We were up at 6 am and picked up 
        my fishing coach (Boland-San) from his penthouse apartment at 6:30 10. He had scouted 
        for locations the previous day and settled on Newell Beach at the mouth of the river. 
        He thought it had good prospects for fish and was open so crocs could not sneak up on us. 
        As an added safety precaution, we brought Kenneth and Vince along as they were more 
        likely to be a target for Crocs than Paul or I as they would make a better feed, and were 
        slower runners! Vince caught his first ocean fish ever! A Dart, which he returned to the 
        sea. To show it wasn't a fluke, he then caught the same fish again, just to show off. 
        Paul and I then jointly caught a nice Trevally (actually I caught it on his rod and then 
        he reeled it in) which is in the freezer waiting for some friends.
        We have been cooking a lot at the camp kitchen and it has been interesting observing all 
        the travellers passing through. There are a lot of European families, who tend to stick 
        to them selves. There is one guy that looks like Hagrid from Harry Potter, who briefly 
        skulks in, makes no eye contact and then returns to his treehouse somewhere. 
        A very old fellow totters past each night, between the amenities and his van. 
        He wears no shirt, but has a huge stomach and pants that resemble boxers trunks. 
        They extend from just below his nipples to halfway down his calf. I would love to take 
        a photo of Hagrid and the Pants-man.

        Happy Birthday Kenneth!!!<br />
        Yep, he is an old man, but we gave him a good birthday breakfast and took him on 
        an outing to Mosman Gorge to celebrate. He even had a caramel milkshake.<br />
        Whilst walking the gorge, we came across this Jane Austin character, wearing a white 
        floppy hat and black skirt, walking the track on her own. We kept bumping in to her as 
        she stopped to look at a waterfall or something and we stopped to look at a cassowary 
        being eaten by a boa constrictor.<br />
        Eventually we said hello a few times. By now we had adopted our usual walking format, 
        Vince and I out the front and Kenneth between 20 and 200 metres behind. Kenneth stops to 
        read every word of every notice board as well as stopping to examine every living creature. 
        Sometimes he stops to examine non-living creatures, and sometimes just stops and stays silent, 
        hoping to attract some timid living creature out of the undergrowth. All of these contribute 
        to him falling behind as he did on this particular walk. <br />
        However it became evident that Jane Austin could not overtake Kenneth. Every 
        time she became level with him, he engaged her in conversation. Nothing lascivious, 
        just the opposite, he would point out some gnarly bark on a fir tree and explain what it was caused by, 
        or some insect chrysalis shell on a tree leaf. After each encounter she would hang back before resuming 
        the walk. She could not overcome the "language barrier" and resigned herself to finishing the walk 20 metres 
        behind us.<br />
        I have also discovered what grey nomads do when they stay in their final winter destination for months on 
        end; - they wash their cars. Not just wash, they wax them, they get every blemish out and even apply 
        ArmorAll to the walls of their tyres, to make them look like they are on a showroom floor in a dealership. 
        Then if they don't plan to use them for a few days, they put a cover over them to stop any new dust from spoiling 
        the gleaming duco. Then, they put people with dirty cars (us) under pressure to go wash their cars. 
        So far we have resisted, but the subtle suggestion from all in our little caravan lane, are getting more frequent. 
        We are starting to get worried and wonder if we will make it to the end of the week, without being forced to wash our car. 
        We have even begun to team up to go to the showers in case we get ambushed with a sponge and bucket.

        Picked up my fishing coach at 6am and headed to Newell beach for another session. Paul hooked 
        a shark and spent 20 minutes fighting to land it. Every time he brought it close in to 
        the beach it took off again dragging his line out. Eventually the line snapped and and it 
        got away. It was a shovel nose shark about 4 foot long and weighing about 15kg's 
        according to the expert. I caught (and landed) a Long Tom about 2 foot long. It has a 
        long pointed snout with sharp teeth and looks like an eel.<br /> I threw it back but later 
        found out from "Rod the wise one" that they are good to eat. Rod is our campsite neighbour 
        who googles everything he can't answer on the spot. Paul was two-nil down in the fish count 
        when he pulled a fast one by changing to small hooks and catching two bait fish to even the score. 
        His two fish were smaller than the bait we had been using, but hey, anything and everything counts 
        in the fishing competition, according to the coach. <br /><br />
        For our last evening in Port Douglas we were invited once again to the Boland 
        penthouse for sunset drinks on the balcony. Sitting on the balcony sipping our craft 
        beer and watching the boats returning from the Great Barrier Reef - it does not get any 
        better than t his. But it did, the Boland's were leaving the next day and pressured us 
        to take their left over gourmet food. Well not much pressure was really needed. So we 
        are upgrading from cheap wine, hamburgers and chips to vintage red, wagyu beef and 
        gourmet cheeses and dips over the next few days. Thanks Paul, Karen and Georgia for 
        putting up with three old nomads for a week.

        Bye bye Port Douglas.<br />
        Uneventful drive up to Cooktown. This means; no jockey wheel incidents and no cattle 
        accidents on the un-fenced road north. Stopped off to look at Black Mountain, an eerie 
        landscape out of place with the surrounding landscape. Apparently it was formed by a 
        large core of magma that solidified into granite, fractured and eroded, leaving 
        thousands of chunks of granite in the shape of a hill. I prefer Rod's theory: that it was 
        deposited there by aliens, possibly after they created the statues on Easter island and 
        had to dispose of the residue. I don't think he got this explanation from Google.

        Vince had his towel stolen last night, at least for a few hours. After a shower, 
        he had hung it on the washing line next to a whole lot of other people's washing. 
        He went to fetch it a few hours later and it was gone, as was all the other washing. 
        We told him not to worry as this is the likely scenario: Mrs Grey Nomad does all the 
        clothes washing and hangs it up on the communal washing line. <br />She then tells Mr Grey 
        Nomad he is slacking off and can go bring in the washing. He has no idea exactly which 
        is his washing, so grabs everything off the line to ensure he does not get scolded for 
        forgetting anything. He returns to the van and says he is hopeless at folding washing 
        and implores Mrs Grey Nomad to do it.<br /> She dutifully does and discovers Vince's towel. 
        She tells Mr Grey Nomad " When have we ever had a pink towel darling? You better go and 
        return it to the washing line- pronto!" He does so immediately and later that night, 
        Vince discovers his towel has re-appeared on the washing line. Either that happened or 
        someone used it to clean up after gutting their fish.<br /><br />

        Last night we stayed up late and played cards and drank port. Unfortunately we didn't 
        put enough insect repellant on and later that night Kenneth and I were kept awake my 
        intense itching and had welts all over our legs and arms. Vince had no bites at all. 
        He reckons this is because he is radioactive, but we think it is just because he tastes 
        like shit. However today we went and bought some Calamine lotion and applied it to our bites 
        with cotton buds. Calamine lotion is bright white and after dabbing a blob of it on all our 
        insect bites we look like a couple of aboriginal dancers made up for a traditional aboriginal 
        ceremonial dance. Or we look like Norman Gunston after an attempt at shaving his legs. We are 
        staying inside tonight!<br /><br />

        We went fishing off the wharf today at the recommended time for catchIng lots of fish 10:30 - 12:30. 
        (Recommended by the website "bait wasters.com.au" I think) This was an hour after a lady had 
        caught 2 large Mackerel using live bait off the same wharf. We caught lots of bait fish, 
        including two caught by Kenneth to open his fishing tally on this trip. We then used some 
        as live bait and cast out, awaiting the big ones. They didn't bite and we gave up at 2pm.<br /><br />

        Vince and Ken spent a few hours in the Cooktown Museum and had a good old chinwag with one of 
        the volunteer curators. I hope he got a word in. They learnt that Cooktown has had its 
        fair share of good and bad luck. From being a gold mining town, receiving a visit from 
        the Queen and being hit by cyclones and a fire that destroyed half the town. Now it is a 
        small town of about 2000 and is mainly focussed on tourism as a launching place to go 
        further up the Cape York peninsula in 4 wheel drive vehicles.

        Left Cooktown and the sand flies behind and started the journey south. We stopped off 
        at the iconic pub, the Lions Den Hotel, for a beer on the way. Actually it was a coffee 
        as it was 9:30am. This is the closest we have come to seeing a quintessential Aussie 
        outback pub on this trip so far. It was full of beer can sculptures, outback photo's, 
        like 4 wheel drive's buried up to the door sills on the beach and weird signs like "Keep 
        your dog out of my pub and I will keep my bullets out of your dog". It reminded me of 
        Daly Waters in the Northern Territory, except it was missing the dozens of bra's hanging 
        from the ceiling.

        After leaving the Lions Den, we were driving along and heard a bang from the caravan. 
        We slowed down to discover we had a puncture, but before we could find a place to pull 
        over, the tyre shredded completely, leaving just mangled rubber and exposed wire. We 
        thought it would be a good idea to change it rather than continue another 130ks to the 
        next town.<br /><br />

        No further mishaps on the way to Wonga Beach and the Pinnacle caravan park. 
        What an idyllic place!; enormous shady trees, two pools, ample grassy open spaces and 
        right on the beach with a row of palm trees creating a wind break. With as many coconuts 
        as you could gather and eat, you could not ask for a better place!. However whenever I 
        say this, the subject of Swedish backpackers comes up.<br />
        We were in amongst a whole lot of fisherman, who each had their own small tinnie. 
        I had a chat with the guy camped next to us. He was spending 5 months here and was 
        here primarily for the fishing off Snapper Island, about 6 k's off shore. His boat 
        had a large reel welded onto the gunwale on one side and it had wire cable attached 
        \to a silver lure and the other end of the cable attached to light rope. He was after
         Mackerel and just trolled around the island until he hooked one. He also had a club 
         on board, which I assumed was to knock the fish senseless, when he brought it 
         alongside his small boat. All the guys have their own boats and go out as a small 
         armada when the weather is good and keep an eye out for each other.<br /> 
         All the wives gather and have a chinwag when the men are out fishing. We know this 
         as Vince interrupted their morning tea and got chatting to them. Vince was formally 
         admitted to the fisherman's wives club, which he gracefully accepted, but declined the 
         offer to partake in some knitting.

        This morning we fixed up a few things like bulbs for the van lights, and then spare 
        fuses for the car after blowing the fuse putting the new bulb in the van. We also 
        got a new spare tyre for the van. We then went to the Daintree village and up Stewart 
        creek rd. From the Stewart creek bridge crossing, I could see the river junction and 
        sunken tree where I hooked, but lost, a Barramundi a week ago. I decided to throw a few 
        lures in off the bridge, but to be on the safe side, took both croc spotters with me. 
        It was low tide and had no luck.

        Drove through Cairns as we continued south and stopped at a Jayco service centre to 
        get a new door latch for the one that had snapped off. At this rate of part failure,

        We woke up at 2am to drive Vince to Cairns airport for his flight home to London. 
        He had a discount ticket and was going via Brisbane, Guangzhou, Easter Island and 
        Lima I think, and getting back to London some time in September.<br />
        We got back to the caravan park at 6:15 am as the sun was rising and went to bed for 
        another sleep. Woke up, again!, and went fishing on the pier nearby. Quite a lot of 
        baitfish around, and after catching some I put one on as live bait on for a big catch, 
        but it did not happen. After the high tide at midday, they stopped biting so we came home.
        <br /><br />
        I have discovered a new branch of the grey nomads and named them the Silver Migrants. These 
        are past Grey nomads who have done the travelling around Australia and have discovered their 
        \own individual paradise spot. They now no longer travel randomly around the country, 
        but migrate each year from their home base down south, to their specific winter destination, 
        for between 3 and 5 months. They even home in on the exact same campsite spot at their chosen 
        destination. They also no longer need off road caravans, so have upgraded their all terrain 
        ones for top of the range Jayco Silverlight and Silverline series vans; hence the Silver upgrade 
        to their name. These monsters weigh three tonnes and come with everything you need for a four 
        month stay away from home, except pot plants and lap dogs.<br />
        So far I have discovered three sub-species of this new group:<br />
        1) The Wonga mackerel fishers, who predominantly migrate to catch Mackerel around Snapper Island; <br />
        2) The Port Douglas car buffs, who predominantly congregate around their polished and gleaming cars. <br />
        3) And the Mission beach..... Not sure what draws them here, there are no astounding qualities of the caravan park, 
        no shared fixation on fishing, the only thing that could be drawing them back, year after year is the Pizza oven 
        that is provided each Friday night, where you BYO pizza and the park owner cooks it for you in the oven. 
        So the Mission Beach Pizza lovers it must be!<br />
        We joined in with the Mission Beach Pizza lovers for happy hour and duly had our pitiful 
        Woolworths pre made pizza cooked with their gourmet creations piled high with exotic 
        toppings. Ken had a good chin wag with another Ken we sat next to for the evening, which 
        duly finished up at bed time - 7pm.<br /><br />

        Sadly Vince has left us and we will miss him. His witty conversation, his willingness to 
        take on any task and his singular hostility to the jockey wheel. He was good company and 
        there is far less chatter in our caravan today. On the bright side, the red wine stocks 
        and chocolate stocks may last much longer now and we have far more room in the car after 
        his one cubic meter samsonite bullet proof shipping container has gone.

        Today was a bit overcast with a 20% chance of rain, so we did the washing rally then 
        headed off to check out fishing spots. We had decided to try sunset fishing but wanted to 
        check out the best spots beforehand. The caravan park owner showed us the best places to 
        try, so we set off. We went North first to Bingal Bay and the boat ramp at Muff creek. 
        As we stepped out the car, a horde of mozzies descended on us as if they had not had a 
        good feed in a month.<br /><br /> We tried a few lures but had no success, so moved on to the next 
        location, a beach that was in the green zone, so no fishing allowed. We then went to 
        South Mission Beach and the boat ramp on the Hull River. It was quite a wide river at 
        this point and a useful little pontoon you could fish off. The only problem was it was 
        already occupied by two Bogun Queensland Fisherman and one of their woman folk. They are 
        easy to spot, they have brightly coloured fishing shirts in pink or purple or orange, with 
        fish motif's. Their shirts are all bought from one of my formerly favourite stores, BCF 
        which now stands for "Boguns Come Fishing". They are usually accompanied by non fishing 
        companions, sometimes minding a toddler and always seem to have a can of UDL in a stubby 
        holder no matter what time of day it is.<br /><br /> I chatted briefly to these fellows and found out 
        they had hooked a few bream. We decided this was the best place to come back to at 5pm and 
        have the pontoon to ourselves. We arrived at the river pontoon again at 5pm and to our 
        dismay, the two fellows were still there fishing, with no fish to be seen. If that wasn't
         bad enough, they had been joined by another lady Bogun and her baby in nappies. All 
         happily chatting way at the top of their voices and adding to the ever growing pile of 
         empty UDL cans. We decided to go to the next best alternative, the Clump Jetty. On 
         arriving at the jetty, there was a wedding photo shoot in progress. How romantic I 
         thought, until I realised the jetty in the background was full of fishing Boguns. I am 
         sure they will treasure there wedding photo's nonetheless.<br /><br /> We went to the end of the pier 
         and found a family of Boguns firmly established there and well oiled. There was papa, 
         2 sons, a cousin, one son's wife and a toddlers called Tellulah. I kid you not! Tellulah, 
         was running around in bare feet and doing her best to stand on a fishing hook or fall off 
         the end of the pier.<br /><br /> The remainder of the clan were doing their best to polish off six 
         slabs of UDL and occasionally drop a rod in the ocean. All done at the top of their 
         voices. Kenneth immediately caught a bait fish and I returned to the car to get a big 
         rod to cast it out. On returning to the jetty, the Boguns started referring to me as 
         Crockodile Dundee, with the phrase, "that's not a rod, this is a rod". When I cast it 
         out they came over and asked if my rod could pick up channel 40. Hilarious to them and 
         they all guffawed for several minutes. Needless to say they caught nothing and finally 
         packed up. I think Tellulah had fallen off the pier and been taken out to sea, but none 
         of them noticed. Judging by how much they had drunk, they would probably rate it a great 
         family fishing day.

      <p class="text-panel">
        Drove through Townsville to Alva Beach, about 80 k's South of Townsville. The new caravan 
        park is very spacious and not too full. We were allocated a site but found someone's car 
        parked on it, so we had to get them out of their van and ask them to move it, <span class="red-major">Mistake #1</span>. <br />
        We then set up the camper van and annexe and settled down for some late lunch. The lady 
        behind, who's car was on our site, came out and tut-tutted to Kenneth about how close we 
        were to her dog pen. That is right, you can have dogs here and residents construct intricate 
        little pens for them to stay in. This pen was only about a metre in diameter, so a bit small
        for a Doberman! That was <span class="red-major">Mistake #2</span>.<br /> Kenneth then went to connect the hose for water and while 
        he was fiddling around with it, the dog owner and boat squat man came running out and asked 
        what had Kenneth done as the water in his van had stopped working. Kenneth had not touched his 
        taps, so he went back and forth examining things to no avail. He then disconnected his hose 
        from the tap and the enormous water pressure that had built up, sprayed out all over the other 
        neighbours washing and into his Annexe. After muttering to himself and reconnecting his hose 
        he returned into his van cave. Later that day, the unsuspecting neighbour went to fetch his 
        washing and found it all wet, he also discovered his annexe was all wet. He came over to us 
        and accused us of soaking his washing. Kenneth told him we had done no such thing and it was 
        his other neighbour on the adjoining diagonal site. He grumbled loudly to us " same difference, 
        my washing is all wet". I decided to comment and said to him "it is not the same difference, 
        you accused us of wetting your stuff and we had nothing to do with it". He just grunted and 
        went away. <span class="red-major">Mistake #3</span>.<br /><br /> Later on when he spied the original fellow, he came and accused him. 
        The fellow duly apologised and they briefly discussed his problem with a pressure limiter cock 
        stop valve thingamybob. Needless to say we are not on friendly terms with our 2 neighbours at 
        the back and side of our van, fortunately the other side is a road, so we can't make things 
        worse.<br /><br /> 
        It seems this park is full of grumpy old people. Mr wet washing was hurling abuse at some 
        kookaburra's that landed in a tree near us and were...., well being kookaburra's and making 
        a racket. "Get out of here you noisy bloody bastards!" He shouted. How many people do you come 
        across who chase Kookaburra's away?.<br /><br /> 
        This park has the most rules of any park we have been to so far, 36 rules. It probably 
        started off with about 10 rules and gradually one got added every time a grumpy old fart 
        complained. Some are bizarre like #22 No boots or shoes in dryers or washers or you will 
        be charged. It does not say what charged means, an extra few bucks for the shoe drying 
        service, cost of a new dryer, or charged by the police for contravening rule # 22. Rule #29 
        No smoking cannabis or any other illegal drug on our premises, the police will be called. 
        Rule #14 No loud noise or music after 9pm at night. Rule #34 - Any problems between residents 
        will be dealt with immediate eviction and police called. I have a suggestion for a new rule 
        #37 - Under no circumstances is anyone to enjoy staying here..

        This morning I made polite conversation with the neighbour who had wet the other neighbours 
        washing yesterday. I won him over with my witty charm and before long we were discussing 
        caravan tyre blow out experiences. In the end we were such good mates, he offered me free use 
        of his boat, his dog and his wi... Fi! (What were you thinking?) Seems we may be able stay here 
        without feeling like unwanted squatters anymore.<br /><br />
        The rest of the day was spent in prep for a fishing outing at 5 pm when high tide coincided 
        with sunset, supposedly the best fishing time. But not for us, only caught one small fish and 
        hardly got any bites at all. Kenneth got lots of bites, but they were all by mozzies.

      <p class="text-panel">
        Big day planned today as we were doing a day trip in to see the sights of the big 
        smoke - Townsville. Only problem was I could not hear anything, my ears had become 
        completely blocked overnight. This was both a blessing and a curse, I could no longer hear 
        Kenneth telling me his latest proposed invention, but neither could I hear the coffee 
        percolator. Anyway we went to Townsville and to the Maritime Museum. It was very 
        interesting and had one of its two floors floor, dedicated to the ship Pandora and it's 
        role in the aftermath of the mutiny on the Bounty by Christian Fletcher. Captain Bligh was 
        put off the Bounty in a longboat by the Mutineers, but made it back to England. The Pandora 
        was then sent to recover the Bounty and arrest the mutineers. They caught 14 of them, but did 
        not recover the Bounty as it had been burned. On the way back to England, the Pandora ran 
        aground and sank. The survivors made it back to England via Timor to tell the tale. Enough 
        history for one day. After lunch I decided to tell Kenneth that my ears were blocked and I 
        had not heard anything he had said all day. It is amazing how you can get by with just a 
        grunt and an agreeable nod. Anyway I decided to see a doc and get some ear drops to clear the 
        blockage. <br /><br />
        We then went up the castle hill lookout in the middle of Townsvile. It is about 300m high 
        and offers a spectacular 360 degree lookout of the entire Townsville. I don't think any 
        other town I have been to has such an amazing vantage point to see everything around it, 
        with the possible exception of Cape Town. The hill, in the centre of town is a magnet for 
        fitness fanatics and we counted at least 50 people going up or down the hill at 4pm on a 
        Tuesday. There was even a one legged bike rider making the ascent.<br /><br />    
        Townsville is like any other town of 200,000 people after the apocalypse and a zombie 
        invasion. It was dead. It was like 90% of the population had been abducted by aliens and 
        the remaining 10% hadn't noticed and were just going about their daily routine. I wonder 
        where everyone was, out on manouevers, this is a military town I guess. At least you don't 
        have to queue at the doctors.<br /><br />
        On the final few kilometres back to Alva beach, we came across a tortoise slowly crossing 
        the road from the swamp on one side to the cane fields on the other side, presumably for a 
        sugar fix. Kenneth's wildlife preservation passion kicked in and we stopped so he could 
        move it off the road and out of harms way. However when he returned from his compassionate 
        rescue, he stank like Turtleman from the swamps of Mississippi. I made him ride the 
        remainder of the way home with his hands out the sun roof, just like in Priscilla Queen of 
        the desert.<br /><br />
        Had to drive back into Ayr for cotton balls to plug my ears after putting the ear 
        drops in. On the way back, you guessed it I rode over the tortoise coming back from the 
        cane fields. I haven't plucked up the courage to tell Kenneth yet.

        Woke up today in an aural fog. I can hardly hear anything and even resorted to talking to Kenneth 
        via writing on my iPad.<br />
        Kenneth went to the doctors for his Malaria, Ross river fever and leprosy. The doc gave 
        him antibiotics, antibacterial cream and medicinal soap and told him to 
        "toughen up buttercup".<br /><br />
        I went fishing at a good spot I had identified earlier. Unfortunately someone had grabbed 
        my spot so I had to fish 200 meters further down the beach. They caught a 40cm flathead 
        from my spot and I caught nothing. A few people walking along the beach tried to chat to
        me, but I couldn't hear them , so they just walked off muttering that I was another Dutch 
        tourist that could not speak English.<br /><br />
        Tonight is Chinese night at the caravan park. Everyone has to dress up in their best 
        Chinese outfit and we will be parading around the campground like Mao's army at Tiananmen 
        square. Not really, you just have to order food from the local Chinese takeaway and they 
        will have it delivered at 6pm at the camp kitchen, right after happy hour. As I could not 
        engage in conversation and Kenneth has a 10 metre exclusion zone around him, we declined 
        the invite to Chinese night.

        Winter is over - Jon Snow..<br />
        It's a miracle, I can hear again. The nurse offered to tell my partner it would take 
        another 3 days before I could hear again. Small town humour I guess, but I declined anyway, 
        to keep Kenneth out of it.<br /><br />
        Drove around Bowen, looking for a coffee shop, but could not find one. I don't know how 
        Paul and Karen managed to live here for so long with no coffee shops. Perhaps that was long 
        ago, before coffee was invented and they got addicted.<br />
        Arrived at Airlie Beach and it is fantastic, what an idyllic holiday destination. 
        Wonderful Marina, restaurants, shops, accommodation, etc. it has a Mediterranean feel to 
        it and reminds me of sailing around Croatia. This is definitely a place I would like to 
        return to on a more upmarket holiday budget.<br /><br />
        I am noticing that there are not than many small Jayco camper-trailer's around on this 
        trip and I am starting to get a bit of "van envy". Everyone seems to have a bigger van 
        than me! Their vans are; easier to set up, have hot and cold running water, television, 
        a large queen size bed, a shower and toilet and ...........bugger it, I think I will go 
        and torch them all. We have an annexe, a wine cellar(cupboard) and a good coffee pot, 
        so stuff them!

        Spring is here - Hooray!<br />
        First day in Airlie beach and I have learned from my fishing coach that the most important 
        thing to do is a reco of the area. Best place to get the low down is the local tackle shop, 
        so I headed there with a map of the area. I spoke to Mrs Tackle and she told me 3 good places 
        to go, what bait to use, and even how to arrange my tackle. I planned to visit one of the spots 
        at sunset and another one at Shute harbour in the morning at high tide.<br /><br />
        Went fishing at sunset at one of the designated spots. Kenneth went to the beach next door 
        to get some seawater therapy for his legs. I took two rods but the fish were biting so 
        frequently I could not keep up with their demand for my wonder-bait, squid. 
        In ninety minutes I had caught 10 fish and 4 different species. Unfortunately none 
        were keepers.<br /><br />
        That night they had a singer at the caravan park all the way up from Mackay. His name was 
        Peppe Tucci (no I did not make up his name). He crooned his way through 80's songs while 
        everyone had the catered roast. There was even a meat raffle but we missed out on the 
        prize. We had not opted for the roast dinner, so returned to the caravan and cooked some 
        salmon on the stove inside, against my better judgement..<br /><br />
        I bought a few bottles of Sangria for the night and introduced Kenneth to it. I did warn 
        him of the high alcohol content. As the night progressed, he became more mellow, with a 
        happy smile on his face, and sat staring off into the darkness. Best of all he became less 
        talkative. He is a Sangria convert and wanted to go buy 3 dozen 1 litre bottles the next day.<br /><br />
        I awoke at three in the morning from a fishy dream to the smell of fried salmon. I knew we 
        should have cooked outside. I hope the smell of salmon leaves the van before Liz gets here..

      <p class="text-panel">
        Got up at 6:30 am and went to Shute harbour to fish at the 2nd place Mrs Tackle told me 
        to go. It was down behind a derelict motel, on a disused path. I thought it was either 
        a good spot to fish or likely that we would be featuring in the Deliverance 2 movie.<br />
        We were not getting many bites and were having a chat when I had a strike on my trusty 
        squid. It was a Queenfish which I soon landed. It came in officially at 52cm, so was 
        going to be dinner that night. I cut off two fillets and threw the carcass into the bay. 
        A large fish eagle swooped down and picked the carcass out of the water and headed across 
        the inlet to its nest. It felt good catching a feed for us and a nest full of fish Eagles 
        too. No other fish were biting so we packed up and went home.<br /><br />
        Later in the afternoon we cruised the Main Street of Airlie Beach and stopped for a beer on a hotel terrace. 
        It was nice to just sit and watch the passers by. One thing I noticed was the number of young 
        women with tattoos in the middle of their backs. This is a bit weird, because it is the one 
        place they cannot see their own tattoo. They would have to turn their back to a mirror and 
        strain their neck to look back over their shoulder to see it. Even then, any writing would be 
        transposed in the mirror so they would not be able to read it. They may come out with a tat 
        that says "Soul of God" looking in the mirror, but at first glance looks like it reads "doggy 
        style " to everyone else. Right know I can just hear Liz's voice saying "They are not getting 
        the tat for their own viewing pleasure - you idiot!". So, makes me think, if I ever do want to 
        get a tat, I should have it put in the middle of Liz's back.<br /><br />
        As we sit on the terrace overlooking the Marina, sipping our cocktails, I can't help think 
        that Airlie beach is the ideal holiday destination. Actually we are sitting in the annexe, 
        drinking Sangria out of plastic cups staring straight at the side of a Jayco Sterling 10 
        foot away. Our caravan park cannot be better placed in town though, it is within easy 
        walking distance of the boardwalk around a marina with good fishing, a Coles, a bottle shop 
        and a Bunnings up the road. I can't think of anything else that you could add to this to 
        improve it.<br /><br />
        Oh and the pool is really swish, Thai resort style and the duck troop is really friendly 
        even if they do manage traffic very slowly. Fortunately, the ducks are not allowed in the 
        pool - park rule #97.

        Reluctantly left Airlie beach and travelled about 150 k's South to Blacks Beach, Mackay. 
        The Caravan park here is another great find, right on the beach with big shady tree's, 
        friendly (so far) neighbours and only 22 rules.<br />
        The beach is magnificent, stretching for 6 k's and only 50 metres from our campsite. 
        The neighbours say there is good fishing for mackerel only 500 meters away from the 
        campsite - we will see...

        Checked the tides and decided to go fish from 9:00am - 11:00 am. After a short walk to 
        the spot, where the other fisherman were standing, we cast our 3 gang hooked pilchards 
        into the sea. Kenneth was having trouble remembering how to get a good cast in from his 
        glory fishing days 35 years ago, so I did a long cast for him. After about an hour, 
        Kenneth hooked and landed a large mackerel of 53cm, a keeper and dinner for tomorrow night. 
        Kenneth lost sight of his line while reeling in his catch and did not notice that the fish had 
        already been landed on the beach about 20 foot away from him. So he was quite surprised when I 
        walked up to him with his fish. We cut two nice big fillets out of it..<br /><br />
        That night was pizza and quiz night at the camp kitchen. We signed up to ingratiate 
        ourselves with the friendly grey nomads. The pizza's duly arrived right on time at 6:00 pm, 
        fetched in a golf cart from the local pizzeria and wrapped in blankets to keep them warm, all 
        40 of them. When the golf cart arrived with a large bundle wrapped in blankets, I thought 
        maybe one of the nomads had had a heart attack with the excitement of the quiz and pizza night, 
        fortunately this was not the case. It went quiet for 15 mins while the pizza's were being scoffed. .<br /><br />
        We were invited to join a nearby table for the quiz night because they thought we looked 
        brainy. Our team was called The Bugs. I am not sure if that was sick humour with reference 
        to the state of Kenneth's insect bite marks still on display. Every time they shouted out 
        our team name, a cold shiver went down Kenneth's spine. The best team name was "wear the 
        fox hat". Get it ?. A common second question after grey nomads are asked "Where you from mate?".<br /><br />
        For each round of the quiz, if there was no winner, a rep from each team was volunteered 
        to identify a songs title and then sing the song. Our team tied at the top for one round 
        of the quiz and Ken was selected as our rep to identify the song. It was 
        Smashmouth's "allstar" from the Shrek movie. Kenneth got it straight away and then carried 
        on singing and dancing around like Shrek did in the movie. He sang the whole song and in 
        the end had to helped down from on top of the barbie where he had climbed up to deliver 
        the finale. He got a standing ovation! The quiz finished right on time at 8:00 pm and 
        everyone was sent to bed..<br /><br />
        I think I may have to ration Kenneth's Sangria quota from now on.

        Got up relatively early and went to fish at "the spot". A few fellow caravanning fishermen 
        were already there and had been for a few hours. Ken hooked another Mackerel but this time 
        it got away. I have yet to catch a fish here in Mackay and might have to get up a bit 
        earlier tomorrow to do so.<br /><br />
        We went on a self-guided sightseeing tour of Mackay city this morning. We cruised up and 
        down the streets of the city centre, went to the riverside a few times and after 2 hours 
        \of painstaking scouting could not find a highlight, not one! Mackay has ingeniously 
        obscured their beautiful river behind industrial warehouses and designed a grid system 
        town centre with no redeeming features at all. Even the wharf and Marina precinct is dead. 
        It makes Melbourne's docklands look like a party zone by comparison. There was more life 
        going on at our caravan park on quiz and pizza night than Mackay's city centre at peak time.<br /><br />
        I have devised a cunning plan for catching up to Kenneth in the Mackay fishing competition 
        stakes. I am going to give him lots of Sangria tonight so he sleeps like a log all night. 
        Then, I am going to get up as soon as I hear the first kookaburra, take all the bait, 
        and go fishing. By the time he wakes up, works out I have gone fishing and walks down the 
        beach to find me, I should already have 3 mackerel in the bag - simple.

        The plan did not work. I drank just as much Sangria as Kenneth and only woke up after the 
        third kookaburra call, the same time Kenneth awoke. We both went fishing together, but 
        caught nothing. There were schools of baitfish around and the mackerel went after them in a 
        feeding frenzy. Chasing them up and down the beach. It seemed every mackerel within a one mile 
        radius was part of this action and no-one caught anything. You can't really blame the mackerel 
        in choosing a fresh tasty baitfish and a bit of fun chasing them around over a soggy thrice 
        thawed head of a sardine. I know what I would choose.

        Our last day at Blacks beach and our last chance to get another Mackerel before packing 
        up and leaving. We planned to fish from 6:00am to 8:00am. However it starts raining at 
        about 3:00 am and was still raining when I got up at 7. I said to Ken I was not that keen 
        that I would go fish in the rain. He said it was not raining, it was just fog that had 
        rolled in from the sea. I said I heard rain for most of the night and it was still doing 
        so. I went outside and it was true, there was no rain, only extreme moisture in the fog, 
        condensing on the leaves of the tree above our caravan and dripping on us. 
        Five metres away, out from under the tree, on the road it was perfectly dry.<br /><br />

        So I left Mackay, the mackerel capital of Australia, without catching a mackerel or any 
        fish at all.<br />
        Drove to Emu Park, a small seaside town about 30 k's out of Rockhampton and 20 k's from 
        Yeppoon. It is a really pretty little town, and reminds me what Victorian seaside towns 
        were like 30 years ago, before they become popular and the developers moved in. It only 
        has about 20 shops and none of them are Coles or Woolworths. It has a very active RSL and 
        an artistic memorial boardwalk dedicated to war veterans overlooking the sea. There is 
        even a picture of the landing at Anzac Cove in Gallipoli painted on glass, where you are 
        supposed to line up the horizon of the sea behind with the horizon in the picture and 
        imagine the islands in the background are navy vessels. Quite unique.<br /><br />

        I have decided that a good way to rate towns we stop at is by their score on my new 
        "colesworth" measure. They get 1 point for each Coles or Woolworths store. So Port Douglas 
        would rate a 1. Cooktown and Emu Park a zero and Mackay a 6. IGA's do not count. Generally 
        a score of 1 or 2 is desirable, anything above this is too cosmopolitan. However, I haven't 
        worked out how to factor in the desirability of a good coffee shop.

        We tried fishing at a place called "the timbers" on Cawarral Creek. It is named this as 
        there are quite a few submerged logs where fish like barramundi hide out. Nothing was 
        hiding out there today and all we did was snag our line on the bloody " timbers". 
        Fortunately the tide was going out, so after an hour we went and retrieved our snagged tackle. 
        I did catch a small bream when the fish went on the bite briefly for 30 minutes.

        (Half way)<br />
        Yep we are half way through the 10 week adventure and I would like to stop here and 
        acknowledge my wonderfully accepting darling beloved wife Liz. Liz has been very 
        understanding and supportive of me taking such a long break, with her only being part of 
        it for two weeks. Thanks Darling!
        I do have this niggling feeling that it will be used as a reference point in future 
        holiday plans, something along these lines:<br />
        "Honey, remember your 10 week caravanning trip in 2017?"<br />
        "Yes"<br />
        "Well the girls and I are planning a girls weekend away in a few months time"<br />
        "That's fine"<br />
        "We are thinking of going to Paris"<br />
        "Really!"<br />
        "Via New York, London and Venice!"<br />
        "All that in one long weekend?"<br />
        "Actually it will be just a little bit longer, we are going for a month"<br />
        I really should not put these ideas out there, should I?<br /><br />

        Went to the local (and only) bistro in town for a meal. It was really packed and I 
        reckon half of the population of Emu Park were there. Only rugby league was on the TV 
        and the clientele were either in Rugby league shirts of the Brisbane Bronco's or BCF 
        fishing shirts which they hadn't changed since their day out on the water. The food was 
        great though and highly recommended.

        Departed Emu Park and farewelled the best coffee shop we had found on the trip so far. 
        Drove to 1770, sometimes known as Seventeen Seventy. 1770 got it's name because that is 
        the year that Captain Cook made his second landing on Australian Soil, the first being 
        Botony Bay, now Sydney" the actual towns full name is "1:30pm 24th May, 1770" but everyone 
        calls. It 1770 for short. I am glad the trend for naming places after dates didn't take 
        off, otherwise the IOC would have been announcing "and the winner is..........1769".

        The 1770 camp ground is right on the beach at the end of a peninsula, on the inlet side, 
        so the beach is sheltered and calm. Apparently it is the only place on the east coast of 
        Australia where you can see the sun set over the water.<br />
        Our campsite is five metes from the waters edge at high tide and is surrounded by many 
        trees that offer ample shade. We did not even need to put the awning up as we only get 
        dappled sunlight through the trees at any time of day. We have a prime spot, spot 2A, 
        which is only 6 campsites away from the camp Kitchen adjacent to where Captain Cook 
        actually landed his tender back in 1770. Presumably to come ashore and cook something.

      We have some good neighbours here, on one side are some grey nomads. Kenneth got 
      chatting to them and ask where they had just come from. They could not answer him as they 
      had forgotten. Got up in the morning, packed up their van, drove off to 1770 and could not 
      remember where they had slept the night before. If all grey nomads are like this I may have 
      to rethink what actual nomad activity they do get up to. Perhaps they are not travelling 
      around Australia at all, like we all think. They could just be traversing back and forth 
      between two places and just forgetting they had been to each place before. If this is indeed 
      the case that they are so forgetful, they could save themselves a lot of trouble and just set 
      up their vans in their own backyard. They would go to sleep in their vans and get up the next 
      morning and marvel at the great camp facilities at their new caravan park. Wonderful camp 
      kitchen, TV room and toilet block, all complete with a personal key.<br /><br />
      On the other side we have a young couple and their son from Queensland. They have a tent 
      trailer and every modern camping accessory you could think of. I think they went into Ray's 
      Outdoors and asked for one of everything. It is a good thing they are staying a week as it 
      has been three days now and they are still setting things up. On the bright side though, 
      they have a two person fishing kayak. I helped them carry it to the water and they have 
      offered it to us to use when they aren't using it. They caught a large flathead fish 
      trolling from it yesterday.<br /><br />

      I had done some internet searching of where to fish in 1770. I came across a place called 
      the "Catwalk" on the ocean side of the 1770 peninsula headland. It is called the catwalk 
      because you have to walk gingerly across cliff side paths and clamber over large rocky 
      outcrops to get there. So we decided to go there. For added safety we made sure we had 
      one hand free to hold on while we traversed the catwalk. Sort of a new adventure sport, 
      rock climbing and land based game fishing. This place is supposedly the best land based 
      game fishing ledge on the east coast of Australia. When we approached the rock ledge the 
      people already on the ledge told us which crevasses to follow to get up to the ledge, which 
      was very helpful advice. Once we arrived on the ledge, I thought it was a photo shoot for 
      everything BCF sells. There were about 8 other people on the rock and 4 of these were mates 
      who took the sport very seriously. They had fishing gloves, face covering scarves, fishing 
      shirts, shoes and pants and their equipment was top of the range lures, rods, and braid. They 
      even had a 20 foot gaff, to haul their catch up the rock face. These guys were very friendly 
      though, and told us they were up from Sydney for a week and had spent dawn to dusk on this 
      rock fishing. They had caught 15kg and 20kg tuna's and two juvenile black Marlin so far. They 
      were very helpful and friendly as I baited up my float. The water was very deep below and I 
      put a sinker on and threw it in with a pilchard on and caught a Bonito. Fish for dinner again!<br /><br />

      If I were a fishing blogger, I would have described it in a bit more detail like this: I had done 
      a reco of the ledge a few days earlier and decided that the optimum fishing time for 
      southern well-fed Bonito would be after 3:30pm on Mondays. I had chosen my trusty "Ugly Stick" 
      12 foot surf rod and combined it with my Shimano hyperglide, ceramic ball bearing ultimate 
      6000 reel. All available at only triple cost price from Shylocks tackle shop at 1288 the 
      Esplanade, Yeppoon. I had chosen double ganged 4.0 hooks and attached them to the end of my 
      18 inch red dyed wire leader trace, all joined to my 200lb breaking strain monofilament 
      fluorescent braid with the trusty round turn and 2 half hitch knot. I then threaded on a 
      thrice defrosted pilchard with one hook through the eyes and the second hook through the 
      backbone and tied it on with 17 loops of white wax-dipped bait cotton. All bought from Shylocks 
      again. I then casted a good 10 meters into the deep pools below the rock and before long were 
      getting that familiar tap tap on the line from inquisitive bait fish. Then it all happened, a 
      large bite from a predator fish, an equally large lunge from me and the fish was hooked and 
      Kenneth was woken from his slumber. <br /><br />

      After fighting it gallantly, and working out what the drag was for, I winched my trophy fish 
      up the cliff and proudly displayed it before an appreciative crowd that had gathered 
      (Kenneth). It was at least a 40cm Bonito and good eating. After finishing up for the day, 
      Ken and I like to stay at "Martha's ramshackle dives". At only$489 a night they have 
      everything a fisherman needs after a hard days fishing with a great view of the outlet 
      pipe into the inlet.

        (RIP fellow cyclist)<br />
        Spent a quiet 2 days laying about on the inlet beach, swimming and fishing, without any 
        catches. Mid morning on Wednesday I heard an ambulance go up the road followed shortly by 
        a police car. I immediately thought there may have been an accident on the dangerous 
        fishing rock platform that we had fished off on Monday. When 30 mins later a fire engine 
        went past, I decided to go for a walk up the road to see what had happened. Five hundred 
        metres up the road I found out that a cyclist riding up the final hill of his ride had had 
        a heart attack, fallen off his bike into the forest and died. The couple who found him, 
        whom I chatted to, administered CPR until the ambulance came and tried using a 
        defibrillator to re-start his heart. They were unsuccessful in reviving him.<br /><br /> I carried 
        on with my walk but felt depressed and disturbed about this poor fellows untimely demise. 
        I did not walk back past the ambulance so returned via the nature trail. In a dip in the 
        trail, I came across a couple snogging on the path ahead of me. As I approached, they saw 
        me, but ignored me and I had to walk off the path to get around them. As I climbed out of 
        the dip, a leprechaun at the top of the stairs asked me if there was any thing worth seeing 
        down in the dip. "Only a couple snogging" I replied so he decided to turn around and return 
        along the same path as me. He was about 4 foot tall with a very slight build, had ginger hair 
        and beard, wore spectacles and an orange singlet. He jogged past me then stopped to recover 
        and I caught up with him (normal people take bigger steps than leprechauns). We then walked 
        together and chatted. He was from Bundaberg and had lived there for the last 18 years and hated the place. He said there were 3 druggies living on his street which was symptomatic of the entire town. He was staying at the same caravan park as us and was up for a 4 day break to get away from Bundaberg. When we passed his campsite I noticed he was sleeping in what could be best described as a dog transporter towed by a Hyundai Elantra. If you know Hyundai Elantra's you will know they struggle to tow their own back wheels, but probably appropriate for towing the leprechaun caravan. I wished him good luck for the rest of his break.
        That has got to be the most bizarre 40 minute walk I have ever had!<br /><br />
        For our last night in 1770 we did not go fishing! Instead we watched the sun set over the 
        waters of the inlet. I took a romantic sunset photo and sent it to my beloved. 
        We then went to the campsite bistro 20 foot from our caravan. It was BYO drinks (and glasses), 
        so I had to come back to get the glasses . I ordered a mackerel that I thought would be like 
        the one Kenneth caught and cooked for me. However this one was a huge disappointment, as it 
        seemed to be a fish finger straight from the frozen food pack into the deep fryer, in fact all 
        the meals were, including Kenneth's Parma.<br /><br />
        At the bistro this night we also reached a new low also in romantic restaurant attire when 
        some fellow diner rocked up in his BCF fishing shirt. No doubt he had worn it all day whilst 
        out fishing and wiped his bait soaked hands on it multiple times. I think it is time to move on!

        (The Elliott heads arrive in Elliot heads)<br />    
        Arrived at Elliott Head's pretty early as it is only 150kms from 1770. Consequently we 
        had the caravan and annexe set up before midday, a record. We decided to reward ourselves 
        with a bit of retail therapy so went off to the large mall in Bundaberg. It was just like 
        any other shopping mall in Australia. I went all out shopping at Kmart and bought an iPad 
        cover, an iPhone cover and six glass wine glasses for the more sophisticated company we 
        will be keeping in the future (sorry Vince). I was embarrassed with our plastic wine 
        glasses at the BYO bistro at 1770, so decided to splurge on some real glass.<br /><br />
        We went to the Elliott heads bowls club for the Thursday night roast special. It was just 
        as expected, a good feed, like Sunday roasts at home and well worth the $10.

        (Helen's arrival)<br />
        And a good thing too as the pile of dirty washing since leaving Melbourne is huge and we 
        have very little left to wear. Only kidding, Kenneth has been up since dawn, cleaning the 
        caravan until it is spotless. He took down the curtains and washed them, all the bed linen 
        was washed too. He took out the carpets and beat them, scrubbed the floor, the ceiling and 
        the windows. He even cleaned the outside of the van. I had to stop him going to far when 
        he wanted to crawl underneath the caravan and clean 10 years worth of road grime off the 
        underside. I reasoned with him that Helen was unlikely to get under the caravan to notice 
        how clean it was or wasn't.<br /><br />
        Kenneth even started to sing a happy clappy song before seven in the morning. It went like this:<br />
        I'm a lonely little nomad yes I am, clap clap clap<br />
        I'm a lonely little nomad yes I am, clap clap clap<br />
        I'm a lonely little nomad, cause I miss my wife so bad<br />
        I'm a lonely little nomad yes I am, clap clap clap.<br /><br />
        I told him to keep quiet before he woke the neighbours up.<br /><br />
        He then turned his attention to himself. Normally he showered in 15 minutes but today he 
        was in the amenities for over an hour. I could smell him coming back from 50 metres away, 
        all shaved and perfumed up like in his courting days. In all his final preparations for 
        Helen's arrival he failed to get the most important provision for her arrival, some champagne.<br />
        Kenneth picked Helen up from the airport and I went fishing and caught a small fish which at the 
        time of writing had not yet been identified by the guru Boland-San.

      <h3 class="date-panel text-center"> Saturday 16th September</h3>
      <p class="text-panel">
        Today the three of us went to the number 1 tourist attraction in Bundeberg, the Bundaberg 
        distillery. We decided on the full hour long tour to fully immerse ourselves in the rum 
        experience and it was well worth it. They make rum from just 3 ingredients; molasses, water 
        and yeast. They get the distinctive bundy taste by maturing it in oak barrels for 2 years. 
        A barrel holds 43,000 litres and is worth $7 million. They have 300 of these barrels, so when 
        they are full, there is $2.1 billion worth of rum on the site. The whole distillery is 
        surrounded by high electrified fences to keep wayward drunkards out. We were not allowed 
        to take any battery operated device on the tour in case it could ignite the alcohol fumes 
        and start a fire. At the end of the tour we could sample two of the products, so we went 
        for the most expensive one at $187 a bottle. Not being a rum drinker I was underwhelmed and 
        so was Kenneth, who is a rum drinker. Needless to say we bought none of the products.<br /><br />
        Returned home to a complete transformation of our quiet and peaceful caravan park. 
        School holidays had started and the caravan park had completely filled up with holidaying 
        Queensland families. Every spare blade of grass was covered by a tent, a tarp or a gazebo. 
        It was like a UN refugee camp had sprung up. They all seemed to arrive with trailers 
        stuffed with every moveable toy from home, bicycles, kayaks, fridges, hammocks, tables 
        chairs , goats, a pig and even a miniature pony arrived. Every kid old enough to blow his 
        own nose was on a bicycle hooning around the park. Grey nomads have taken cover and hid in 
        their vans from 4pm onwards. Our next door neighbour from the previous night said they were 
        heading inland to escape the hoards. We returned home from dinner at the local bowling club 
        to discover we no longer had power to our van. Some kid had cut through our campsite on his 
        bike and ridden over our power cord, causing it to come out at the plug. Many of the gazebos 
        have fairy lights all over them so the kids can find their way home after drug dealing on the 
        beach. It looks like Christmas time in Bourke street mall and is just as loud. Fortunately 
        we are leaving tomorrow, but I fully expect every park from now on to be packed with Queensland 
        Boguns - bring on the end of school holidays!<br /><br />
        Our next door neighbours decided to host a setting up camp soirée and spent the evening 
        discussing every topic they hold dear; 2017 tattoo trends, tattoo removal, "should kids 
        under 10 be tattooed" and camp kitchen etiquette. This took them well past the 10pm quiet 
        time and it was only just before midnight when they decided to go to bed. I think they may
        have had an early morning tattoo appointment.<br /><br />
        I have sadly come to the realisation that my preference is for a caravan site full of 
        grey nomads rather than one full of young families with dozens of kids. Sad isn't it.

        (Escape from planet Bogun)<br />
        We made an early departure, as did every other grey nomads that had mistimed the invasion, 
        and headed for Hervey Bay. The trip was short so we stopped in at Childers for a morning 
        coffee break. Childers is a very scenic town with a great Main Street full of bakery coffee 
        shops. "Let's stop here" Kenneth predictably requested, so we did. Childers is the main town 
        of the Isis district of Queensland, the name deriving from the Isis river and the Egyptian God 
        of fertility. It seems ironic in today's times to see posters from the Isis RSL inviting new 
        members to join.<br /><br />
        We then travelled to Hervey Bay to pleasantly discover that our campsite is a bit away from 
        the beach and is a grey nomad refuge with not a Bogun family in sight. Luck of the draw as 
        this was not planned. Harvey Bay has a wonderful 16km esplanade, a very nice Marina and an 
        850 metre jetty. Along the 16km waterfront were at least three other campsites, that were 
        packed full of families with every moveable piece of camping and boating paraphernalia you 
        can buy from BCF.     <br /><br />
        We walked along the long jetty and saw a fisherman catch a seagull, and many others catch 
        bait fish. (Fishermen, not seagulls) The serious fishermen here have adapted bicycles to ride 
        to the end of the long jetty. The bikes have rod holders at the back and place for a tackle 
        box. I think Boland-San would be proud to own one of these.

        Not sure what happened to Monday. Ken and Helen went on a whale watching tour from 11 to 2pm 
        while I went fishing off the rocks. I would say they were more successful than I, as I only 
        caught a small flathead. However the whale watching was a complete success, with many whales 
        seen breaching and diving including mothers with their calves. Ken and Helen were very impressed. 
        I convinced Ken to by a "whale foundation" cap, so he is looking cooler by the minute, he now has 
        a cool eco-friendly hat and mirror shades. Helen also bought him a new pair of Jesus sandles. 
        I have agreed with Helen that she will improve his wardrobe from the bottom up and I will 
        work top down. I refuse to take responsibility for anything below the waist.

        Went fishing off the jetty this morning at 5:45 am. I had bought a bait fish jig at BCF 
        and was keen to try it out. It worked a treat, it has 6 hooks on it with a bit of tinsel 
        around each hook. you drop it to he bottom of the sea and jig it up and down and the fish 
        line up to hook themselves. In no time we had half a dozen small fish and put them on as
         live bait. Kenneth seemed to be most interested in the bait jig and was trying to get a 
         full house of 6 caught at the same time. His best effort was 4 caught simultaneously.

         After we had about 40 bait fish in the bait bucket, I told Kenneth we had enough. 
         Unfortunately we did not land that elusive mackerel but they were caught all around us. 
         I did latch onto a large ugly looking fish that weighed about 2 kg. As I tried to haul 
         it up onto the jetty, it bit through my wire trace and escaped. I was actually quite 
         relieved, as any fish that bites through wire, I do not want to try get a hook out of 
         its mouth. We returned to the campsite to discover a Bogun family had just arrived and 
         were setting up their caravan opposite us.<br /><br /> First Dad and four kids under 8 came to inspect 
         the site, obviously giving it their approval before mum and another baby in nappies arrived. 
         Five kids under 8 with a mum of about 25 years old, and to top it off they had a small dog as 
         well. The caravan, looked like it was a vintage from the sixties and the ford station wagon 
         pulling it was only a few years younger. The kids were all unruly and looked like a tribe of 
         hillbillies come down from the high country somewhere in outback Queensland. The noise in the 
         caravan site in one hour of their arrival was more than the last three days combined. I think 
         all the kids have A.D.D and the parents are frazzled. There are 3 girls, one boy and a baby. 
         The boy seems to have a mean streak and is constantly bullying his smaller sister. 
         When he oversteps the boundaries and hurts her, he is dealt with by the Dad in just as rough 
         a manner.<br /><br />    
         Looking at it on the bright side, at least their dog is quiet and we are leaving tomorrow.

      <h3 class="date-panel text-center"> Thursday 21st September.</h3>
      <p class="text-panel">
        Left Hervey Bay and the hillbilly family behind and travelled to Gympie for a coffee on the way 
        down to Noosa. Gympie was founded as a gold mining town by James Nash, who became very wealthy. 
        Gympie is a very hilly town and the CBD has steep hills and one way roads throughout. 
        It is amazing how complicated a town can make its road systems when there are only about 200 
        people living there. I know it was too complicated for Kenneth, who tried to take us and the 
        caravan down a 1 way street. He then had to back out onto the main road and change course. 
        I was impressed by his first real go at reversing the caravan under pressure. 
        So was the appreciative crowd that gathered and they gave him a round of applause when 
        we drove off.<br /><br /> 
        We then travelled to Noosa and our new caravan park. This place had an expert "helper" 
        giving us instructions on how to reverse into the caravan site. - Groan!!!! But, this 
        guy was amazing. He gave precise detailed instructions, in a Queensland drawl, loud enough 
        for the whole caravan park to hear. It went something like this.<br />
        "Pull up next to the Jaaaaayco over there Maaaate!",.<br />
        "Now right hand down, as far as it can go".<br />
        "Baaaaack up some more, now left hand down, Backup some more, right hand down as far as 
        can go, now easy up and left hand down, backup some more, now come forward, left hand 
        down some more, now back up A few feet with left hand down, foot on the brake, eyes on 
        the mirror and bum in the seat. Oh shit, I have put you in the wrong site, you are 
        supposed to be next door!".<br />
        Seriously though, his were the best reversing instructions I have ever had, even though 
        I could not stop laughing at his Paul Hogan impression.<br />
        This afternoon we had a thunderstorm with marble sized hailstones. 
        It is the first rain we have had since the 2nd day of the trip, almost 7 weeks.
        Queensland is very dry at the moment and everyone is praying for rain.
